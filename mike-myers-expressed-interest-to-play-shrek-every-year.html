When talking about his time in Shrek, he described the film as a story about “classism” disguised in a “Eurocentric form of a fairytale”. He re-recorded his portrayal of the green ogre as Scottish as he believed that they’re “the most working class”.</p><p>“When I was approached to do “Shrek,” originally I did it as a Canadian. And I rerecorded it as Scottish ’cause that to me seems the most working class. I have a love of the Scottish people. I have Scottish ancestry, mostly English but Liverpool is, it’s the pool of life between Scotland, England, and Ireland.”</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>Myers said that he loved the story of&nbsp;Shrek&nbsp;and how “it flips classic fairytales on its head”. He also said that he noticed that his role in the franchise was a dramatic one that he somewhat resonates to and that if given the opportunity, he would be glad to play the character every year.</p><p>“I love the idea of taking a fairytale, turning it on its head, having it be that all the traditional bad guys are good guys, and all the traditional good guys are bad guys. And I realized it’s a dramatic role. I mean, halfway through, I went, there’s an emotional center here…</p><p>… The concept of going from a self-loathing ogre to a self-accepting ogre was meaningful to me. I loved playing Shrek. If I had to do one Shrek a year, I’d be thrilled.”</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Shrek&nbsp;is Dreamworks animated film that won the very first “Best Animated Feature” during the 74th Academy Awards.
