<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Life Or Something Like It movie review (2002)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Example: Sexy Pete the cameraman (<a href=#>Edward Burns</a>) wants to play a trick on Lanie, so he fiddles with her microphone during a stand-up report from the street, and her voice comes out like Mickey Mouse's squeak--like when you talk with helium in your mouth. Everybody laughs at her. Except, see, your voice comes out of your body, and when it goes through the air, it sounds like your voice to the people standing around. When it goes into the microphone, it kind of stays inside there, and is recorded on videotape, which is not simultaneously played back live to a street crowd.</p><p>Lanie dreams of going to New York to work on "AM USA," the network show. She gets her big invitation after attracting "national attention" by covering a strike and leading the workers in singing "Can't Get No Satisfaction" while she dances in front of them, during a tiny lapse in journalistic objectivity. Meanwhile, she is afraid she will die, because a mad street person named Prophet Jack has predicted the Seattle team will win, there will be a hailstorm tomorrow morning, and Lanie will die next Thursday. They win, it hails, Lanie believes she will die.</p><p>This leads to a romantic crisis. She is engaged to Cal Cooper (<a href=#>Christian Kane</a>), a pitcher with the Seattle Mariners. He's in the field, he looks lovingly at her, she smiles encouragingly, the pitch is thrown, the opposing team batter hits a home run, and she jumps up and applauds. If he sees that, she may not last until Thursday.</p><p>Meanwhile, she apparently hates Pete the sexy cameraman, although when Cal is out of town and she thinks she's going to die, they make love, and then we find out, belatedly, they've made love before. The screenplay keeps doubling back to add overlooked info.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46loJ%2BdXaS%2Fbr%2FOppytoJmjtG64yKScZqGkYn9xfJE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leebeth-young-car-accident-update-death-cause-what-exactly-happened.html><span>←</span><span>Leebeth Young Car Accident Update, Death Cause What Exactly Happened?</span></a>
