Keep scrolling to see for yourself…</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-schedule-for-the-rest-of-the-bachelor-season-28 data-injectable=false>What is the schedule for the rest of The Bachelor&nbsp;season 28?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>According to the Bachelor know-it-all, “The Women Tell All is set to tape either Thursday March 7th or Friday the 8th, which lines up with how a lot of past seasons have worked when they haven’t done anything wonky at the end of the season. As of right now, even though ABC hasn’t officially announced everything, here’s how I believe the remaining episodes will go:</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=150 data-injectable=false>2/26 – Episode 7 (Jasper, Alberta)<br>3/4 – Hometowns<br>3/11 – Overnights<br>3/18 – Women Tell All (tapes 3/7 or 3/8)<br>3/25 – Finale Night”</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>Because of this prediction from Reality Steve — who tends to be correct when it comes to spoilers about the Bachelor franchise — the finale will air on March 25, so be sure to mark your calendars and start planning your watch parties ASAP.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=false>Until then, catch brand new episodes&nbsp;of the beloved competition series every Monday on ABC, or stream them the following day via Hulu, to see which of his six remaining women — Jenn Tran,&nbsp;Daisy Kent,&nbsp;Rachel Nance, Maria Georgas, Kelsey Anderson,&nbsp;and Kelsey Toussant — secure their spot in the finale. The next few episodes are sure to be jam-packed with emotion and juicy drama!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSnZKKrXam1pnnBmpqhnZykv26yyKeYpZ1dqbWmedKcn56cpaGybrLOq2StoJViv6a5wKKlnZ2iYrynedKemKynnmJ%2FeXnEsaelmZmjsqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-maze-runner-2014.html><span>←</span><span>The Maze Runner movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2014)</span></a>
