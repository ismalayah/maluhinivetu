You wouldn’t suspect it from first impressions, since Rick can be rather racist, misogynistic, and discriminatory (i.e. Abradolf Lincler), but he’s apparently in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community since he himself is allegedly pansexual. All the way back in 2015, when Rick and Morty was still gaining traction and only just airing its second season, showrunner Dan Harmon and animator/voice actor Justin Roiland attended San Diego Comic-Con, where they reeled in fans to fill out Q&amp;amp;A hall and discuss the whirlwind success of the unconventional hit series.</description></item><item><title>Musical Chairs movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2012)</title><link>/musical-chairs-2012.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/musical-chairs-2012.html</guid><description>Now follow this timeline: Mia had been dating the creepy owner of the dance studio.
