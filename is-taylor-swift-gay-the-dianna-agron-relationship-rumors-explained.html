Ironically, her efforts led to even more speculation, with the added layer of forbidden queer love, which has historically been a huge drawing point for prying eyes. “If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that, right? I would learn later on that people could and people would,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a>.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>While Swift is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">currently dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce</a> following a six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, she has been at the center of a major, years-long conspiracy theory regarding her sexuality. Two major elements of those speculations are Glee player Dianna Agron, and Victoria’s Secret model Karlie Kloss.</p><h2 id=h-is-taylor-swift-gay data-injectable=false>Is Taylor Swift gay?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Taylor-Swift-house.png><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>For years now, Swifties have suffered persistent gossip about their favorite singer/songwriter dating one of her so-called squad members. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">While Miss Americana’s friendship with Karlie Kloss, and their eventual falling-out, is definitely the most famous among the theories</a>, the singer’s close relationship with Agron has also been subject to intense scrutiny. So much so, that the actress was even asked about it in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> interview.</p><p>“That is so interesting. I mean, there have been many stories about my dating life that are so wildly untrue. That’s funny.”</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>Make of that what you will, but, however ambiguous, that sounds like a “no” to us. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s a fact that Swift and Agron were attached at the hip in 2012 and 2013</a>, while the singer and Kloss were inseparable between 2013 and 2015. Yet, there’s no real reason to believe that Taylor’s relationships with these two women went beyond anything more than platonic friendship.</p><p data-characters=700 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>The closest the Midnights chart-topper has ever come to addressing the same-sex relationship rumors that have followed her for years is the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) prologue mentioned above; in it, she makes clear how uncomfortable it makes her that every one of her friendships is instantly twisted into something more. So, even though it’s totally understandable to wonder, it strikes us as unfair to all parties involved to make assumptions about Taylor’s sexuality based on speculation. And it’s definitely not okay to demand that people — famous or otherwise, and whatever their sexuality — reveal personal details they might not be comfortable talking about yet, or ever.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>So, there you have it, folks. If you come across anything digging out these old, albeit frenzied, social media scoops — especially now that Taylor Swift is the talk of every town — you can take them for what they are; rumors, and nothing more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa1koJmpYsGpsYydoJqmnpZ6orPRqKVmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYr%2B2uc6rqmadqKW5orXNnpto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-was-the-jersey-shore-cast-during-season-one.html><span>←</span><span>How old was the Jersey Shore cast during season one?</span></a>
