The search engine began by dropping several hints titled “You’re a Mastermind” in their website “searchplayground,” which fans eventually decoded as the lyric “All the stars aligned” from the closing track of the standard edition of Taylor’s 10th studio album.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>The lyrics then led to another website focused solely on Taylor Swift-related Google stats for the year 2023.

While this alone doesn’t tell us much, when paired with the Google website, it does feel like, for lack of a better expression, all the stars are aligning for “Mastermind” to be the next single from Midnights.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Mastermind” Vinyl in the “Lavender Haze” music video</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taylor Swift pays tribute to boyfriend Joe Alwyn in the “Lavender Haze” music video by including the constellations for their zodiac signs, Sagittarius and Pisces. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Vm3w3p1kJK</a></p>— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=#>January 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>What once seemed simply like a sweet reference to the person we thought had inspired the song “Mastermind” (more on that in a bit) is now being framed as possibly being part of something bigger.</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>If Swiftdom has taught us anything, it’s that Taylor doesn’t just include references in her music videos if they’re not a clue to something. The fact that a vinyl case for “Mastermind” can be seen in the “Lavender Haze” music video (featuring constellations for both Taylor and her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn’s star signs) is suspicious at best.
