Goldsmith's original main title is a gorgeous cue that is indeed incredibly romantic, while still having an air of mystery, with a grand statement of his main theme, a far cry from the more obtuse and esoteric film version, which carries a more foreboding tone and uses wind and string effect influenced by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki originally intended to be used later in the picture.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dr. Howard Krein Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>
