His life’s ambition – one could even call it ‘obsession’ – alongside his rare jutsu, made him the perfect candidate for the depraved ninja Orochimaru to place a curse on him.</p><h2 id=h-the-origin-and-meaning-of-sasuke-s-curse-mark data-injectable=false>The origin and meaning of Sasuke’s curse mark</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Orochimaru-bite.png><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>The Cursed Seal of Heaven is a mark placed on Sasuke’s neck by Orochimaru during the Chunin exams. The mark gives the user the ability to enhance their power, forcibly drawing chakra from the body at its expense, and ultimately, they will end up losing their will to the immoral legendary Sanin.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>The curse mark is shaped like a tomoe – a swirl-like symbol – a similar design to the Sharingan. When used, the mark spreads across the body, changing its color, until it eventually modifies the body of the user making them look nearly unrecognizable – a condition which can be reversed, especially if the cursed ninja has mastered it, like the Sound 5.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>Sasuke got a taste of this power during the second test of the Chunin exams. He was able to break the arms of Sound Ninja Zaku after his team attacked Sakura, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naruto, and himself,</a> as they were weak and recovering in the aftermath of Orochimaru’s attack. It was also almost used during his preliminary fight against Team Kabuto’s Yoroi.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Orochimaru used these cursed seals as a form of research for immortality as well as a sort of control measure over his subjects. The curse had been previously inflicted on Anko Mitarashi, the second proctor during this rendition of the Chunin exams.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Does Sasuke ever get rid of his curse?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>The curse was sealed during the preliminaries after Sasuke qualified for the finals. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Team 7 leader Kakashi Hatake</a> contained it using the Evil Sealing Method, however, it’s only effective if Sasuke doesn’t actively decide to tap into the seal’s power. In this same scene, Kakashi is confronted by Orochimaru, who taunts him saying that it is certain Sasuke will seek him out in search of more power. Unfortunately, this ends up becoming true when the surviving Uchiha deserts the village.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>Years and many, many episodes later, the mark is eventually removed from Sasuke’s body. As the fight against his older brother draws to a close, Itachi uses his Susanoo’s Sword of Totsuka to extract Orochimaru from Sasuke and seal him, effectively freeing his brother from the evil ninja’s fangs.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Sasuke is someone who would do whatever it takes to become stronger. He has unshakable goals that demand it of him. However, by the end of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Naruto series</a> he has begun to realize what truly matters at the end of the day. By the time Boruto rolls around, he’s a completely different person. Undeniably, a rollercoaster of a character arc.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmScraKosm65wKuiZqeeYsCiv9SknGahnmK7or7UraZmp6KetKq6jJqlnWWdmq6vtc2gZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-panned-crime-caper-directed-by-bob-odenkirk-escapes-to-the-streaming-top-10.html><span>←</span><span>A panned crime caper directed by Bob Odenkirk escapes to the streaming Top 10</span></a>
