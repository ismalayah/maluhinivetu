He described on Ellen what he called a “slip of paper” meeting – the kind you see in movies, where a stern businessman slides a scribbled note with a dollar value written on it across the table. After trading his childhood for effective retirement in middle school, he had an estimated personal value higher than most of us can reasonably imagine.</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>How much? According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, around $18 million. That’s money coming from across the ‘90s, including a $10,000 paycheck for Home Alone and, just two years later, 45 times that amount for Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Do you remember the movie Getting Even with Dad? Of course, you don’t. Nobody does. It made $35 million on a $30 million budget, but Culkin collected an $8 million payday for starring in the picture.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Today, the former child star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">treats work like a hobby</a>, acting when he wants to and pursuing other interests. Meanwhile, what do the rest of us get for setting Joe Pesci on fire? A five-year sentence and a work release job writing internet articles about Macaulay Culkin, that’s what. There’s no justice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZ2WsKLBy5qwZpulobiqutJmpZ6sXay8s8DHZqCnZWJlf3R7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./netsky-and-chromeo-go-all-in-with-tnt.html><span>←</span><span>Netsky And Chromeo Go All In With TNT</span></a>
