The ensemble cast each portrayed an ambitious dreamer – be it an actor, dancer, musician, or the like, who wanted to make a name for themselves in a decadent, unbridled, and depraved Hollywood.</p><h2 id=h-who-does-margot-robbie-play-in-babylon-and-why-is-she-nude data-injectable=false>Who does Margot Robbie play in Babylon, and why is she nude?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Margot-Robbie-Babylon.jpg><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Robbie’s character fits into the bunch, as she portrays <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nellie LaRoy</a>, a silent film starlet. While she’s hit it big in the silent industry, she has trouble transitioning to the talkies (which are movies without sound).</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Nellie is also somewhat of a risk-taker, especially as far as modesty and dignity go. Robbie made it clear that, while there are several nude scenes in Babylon, she assured herself that she and Nellie are totally different people. With that separation, all that embarrassment and shame befall just her character, not herself.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, Robbie dished on the nude scenes:</p><p>“I don’t really have a whole lot of modesty left. I don’t feel embarrassed when it’s Nellie doing something. I’d feel embarrassed if it was me, but it’s all her.”</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>And, it isn’t the first time that Robbie has gone nude. In Robbie’s breakthrough role, Naomi Lapaglia in Martin Scorsese’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Wolf of Wall Street</a>, there’s a scene in which Naomi has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, Jordan Belfort.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-margot-robbie-doing-after-babylon data-injectable=false>What is Margot Robbie doing after Babylon?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bombshell-Margot-Robbie.jpg><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Robbie is quite content with leaving her work at the door when she comes home from a long shoot. While Robbie has proven with her role as Harley Quinn that she has versatility and range up her sleeve, she wants to build a barrier between herself and her roles, which are in themselves distinguishable from one another.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Aside from Babylon, Robbie starred in one of the most record-breaking films of all time, Warner Brother’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a>. Rumor has it that she will be leading a Pirates of the Caribbean spin-off with Birds of Prey director Christina Hodson as well, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney might not be entirely convinced</a>.</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=118 data-injectable=false>No matter what Robbie’s next role ends up being, it’s clear that she’s got the acting chops for it.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>Babylon is currently available to stream on Paramount Plus and Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S6or7GqKtmqp%2BXr6qxjJ2grKCVqHqwuoysnK%2Bdopa5brrUnZxmq5Oau6a%2FjKKlZpqRl8atu81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-strauch.html><span>←</span><span>Daniel Strauch</span></a>
