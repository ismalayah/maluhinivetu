Drama ensues whenever Ramsay runs into obstacles such as inattentive owners, terrible menu items and unsanitary surroundings. The show was a huge hit across multiple countries during its run, so much so that it spawned an American adaptation, simply called&nbsp;Kitchen Nightmares.

Drama ensues whenever Irvine runs into obstacles such as inattentive owners, terrible menu items and unsanitary surroundings. Though much lower-rated than either version of&nbsp;Kitchen Nightmares,&nbsp;Restaurant: Impossible&nbsp;has been successful enough for Food Network to continue it for six seasons so far, with more to come.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Just How Bad Is It? 10/10</h3><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>This seems like a pretty obvious case of a less successful channel lifting a successful show idea from a higher-rated network. It happens often, but in&nbsp;Restaurant: Impossible‘s case, there are hardly any differences between the rip-off and the original, though&nbsp;Restaurant: Impossible shows a little bit more of the work Irvine does to&nbsp;actually effect change in the restaurants he visits, as opposed to the more Ramsay-centric&nbsp;Kitchen Nightmares.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=false>Honestly, the only major difference between the two shows is that&nbsp;Restaurant: Impossible&nbsp;opted for a Brit in place of&nbsp;Kitchen Nightmares‘ baudy Scot. After&nbsp;Restaurant: Impossible‘s modest success, Spike TV commissioned their own&nbsp;Kitchen Nightmares&nbsp;rip-off:&nbsp;Bar Rescue, in which long-time bar owner and consultant Jon Taffer attempts to repair failing nightclubs and bars. That show started in 2011 and, like Restaurant: Impossible,&nbsp;is inexplicably still going.</p>Pages: <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>1</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>3</a> <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>4</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>5</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>6</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>7</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiwNOamqRlk6G8r7HSZmxmrKZiwKm71qxkq6GgYrynso5tZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-chung-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jamie Chung Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
