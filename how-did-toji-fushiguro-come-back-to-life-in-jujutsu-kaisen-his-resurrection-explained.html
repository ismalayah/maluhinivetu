He was contracted by the&nbsp;Time Vessel Association&nbsp;to eliminate Riko Amanai, the designated&nbsp;Star Plasma Vessel&nbsp;for&nbsp;Master Tengen’s merger in 2006. Since Riko was under the protection of Gojo and Geto, we see Toji face off against the two in episodes 27 and 28.</p><h2 id=h-toji-fushiguro-s-death data-injectable=false>Toji Fushiguro’s death</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=848 data-injectable=true>During his second battle with Toji <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in Jujutsu Kaisen</a> Season 2 Episode 4 (overall episode 28), Gojo Satarou awakens the true power of Limitless and unleashes an incredibly potent secret&nbsp;extension technique, the Hollow Purple, over Toji. Coming from the Zenin family, Toji knew how to counter Red and Blue. But Purple is created when the Red and Blue infinities combine, creating an imagined mass that rushes forth, erasing everything in its path. This leaves <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Toji Fushiguro’s left half of the body completely destroyed, causing his death.</a></p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>After Riko Amanai’s death and Toji Fushiguro’s ultimate defeat, the series jumps ahead in time to one year later in August 2007. As a result of this incident, Geto suffers in quiet, and Gojo asserts himself as the strongest one. Geto loses his sense of morality at this point and decides to kill every non-sorcerer in the universe, which turns him into an antagonist in the series.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>We are also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced to Toji Fushiguro’s son Megumi</a> in this episode as Gojo had promised Toji to fulfill his last wish and take care of his son. At the end of the episode, the series takes another time leap to a decade later and shifts focus back to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series’ main trio Yuji, Nobara, and Megumi,</a> now grown up.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Toji Fushiguro is resurrected a decade later by a curse user</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Toji-in-Jujutsu-Kaisen-season-2-after-resurrection.jpg><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=870 data-injectable=true>The next episode (ep. 30 overall, ep. 6 in season 2) marks the start of the Shibuya incident arc in the anime. During this arc, we are introduced to a minor antagonist and a curse user nicknamed Granny Ogami, who worked with&nbsp;Jiro Awasaka&nbsp;in the past to make money. She also frequently kidnaps young children to become her “grandchildren.” The eighty-seven-year-old woman resented Gojo as her freedom to commit crimes was deterred by his presence. At some point in time, Ogami met&nbsp;Pseudo-Geto&nbsp;and joined his group to conspire against Gojo.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>During the Shibuya Incident Arc, on Oct. 31, Ogami overhears the news that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gojo has been sealed</a> while guarding the cursed objects that are putting up the screens around Shibuya. When&nbsp;Yuji Itadori,&nbsp;Megumi Fushiguro, and Takuma Ino arrive to destroy the cursed objects, she uses her curse technique to transform her “grandson” into&nbsp;Toji&nbsp;by repeating his name to defend against the trio.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How did Toji come back to life?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>As a curse user, Granny Ogami has an innate technique called the Séance Technique, which allows her to transform herself or a willing participant into a deceased person. Using this technique, she<strong> </strong>can summon&nbsp;both the information of the body and the soul. But since there’s a risk that summoning the soul will overwrite or suppress the vessel’s soul, Ogami only invoked Toji’s physical information into her “grandson.”</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>However, the Toji summoned by Ogami was not the one who fought Gojo in the previous arc, but the one who was at the height of his abilities, back when he was Toji Zenin. So while invoking him, Ogami chants his name as Toji Zenin rather than Fushiguro. Thus, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in season 2 episode 11</a> and chapter 95 of the original manga, Granny Ogami’s&nbsp;Séance Technique&nbsp;resurrected Toji from the dead into her “grandson,” granting him Toji’s physical abilities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Toji-Fushiguro-in-Jujutsu-Kaisen.jpg><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=916 data-injectable=false>Toji, however, was a unique example of a person with a Heavenly Restriction—one that totally eliminated cursed energy. Toji’s physique was honed to the point where he became immune to curses and was able to identify them with his highly developed five senses by eradicating any cursed energy. As a result, Toji’s body was able to override Ogami’s strategy upon resurrection and act only out of his own instinct instead of her instructions. Before Yuji saved him, Toji almost killed Takuma Ino with his bare hands during his uncontrollable wild outburst. He even killed Ogami with a single strike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBllJ6xbsDOo6BmnqWotaqz1KumZpuforJursCcomasn2K5qrLEZqCnZZqqt7bA0q5kpJmZqLKveceiqmaqlajCs77EnKuip55isrm8y5qgp52UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivier-martinez.html><span>←</span><span>Olivier Martinez movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
