Johnny Depp's fans aren't impressed with Amber Heard's testimony.
Ever since Heard, 36, started testifying in Depp's defamation trial, social media has swarmed with accusations the actress is &#34;fake crying&#34; on the stand, according to Fox News.
Heard spent two days on the stand, accusing her ex-husband of physically abusing her.
The actress was frequently in tears as she answered questions about her rocky marriage to the Pirates of the Caribbean star."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
