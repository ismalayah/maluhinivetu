Komen Foundation and The O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, which has treated several of her close friends and family members.</p><p>Jennifer’s respect for the generosity of non-profits inspired her to become a volunteer.</p><p>Currently, she is involved with several charities started by Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama: STAIR tutoring, the Children’s Fresh Air Farm, and Holiday House.</p><p>Jennifer’s husband, <a href=#>Pat Cope</a>, is the founder of Cope Private <a href=#>Wealth</a> — a prestigious financial planning firm. When not relaxing with her husband and two sons in Mountain Brook, Jennifer can often be found exercising, walking her dog, or hiking in the mountains of North Carolina.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tell us about yourself?</h2><p>My name is Jennifer Miree Cope, and I was raised in Mountain Brook, Alabama, and moved back here after graduating from Vanderbilt University in 1985. I worked for Southern Natural Gas Company (SONAT) until my second child, Charlie, was born.</p><p>After both he and my oldest son Bobby were teenagers I re-entered the workforce as a landscape designer. I love the technical aspects as well the natural beauty, plus my time can be very flexible. A <strong>9 to 5 job</strong> wouldn’t work for me.</p><p>I love all things <a href=#>health-related</a> – good food, cardiovascular exercise, strength training, flexibility training/yoga and balance training. I love dogs and can often be seen walking my Havanese, Chester, around the neighborhood. I also love our place in the North Carolina Mountains.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What makes you different than other professionals in your field?</h2><p>I have an engineering background – both by education and by training.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much market share can you capture in the next 3 years?</h2><p>I think 20% is a pretty reasonable number for my market, locale, and industry. But only if I really wanted to go that high.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was the most important part of your professional journey?</h2><p>Overcoming my fear of drawing to be a landscape designer</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the best and worst purchases you’ve ever made?</h2><p>My worst would be an auto-renew subscription for car washes. I forgot I had it and went six years without using it. My best purchase would be my first house.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What takes up too much of your time?</h2><p>Instagram. I really love it on there!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What three pieces of advice would you give to college students/new startup business owners who want to become entrepreneurs?</h2><p>1) Always have a plan.</p><p>2) Don’t be afraid to change your plan.</p><p>3) Success only comes after repeated failures – don’t give up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who has impressed you most with what they’ve accomplished?</h2><p>Someone who has impressed me quite a bit is Condoleezza Rice. When you look at everything she has accomplished, you cannot help but be in awe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What drives you to keep going when it’s really tough?</h2><p>I’m almost obsessive about getting whatever tasks I have completed, and I think that plays a very large role in my success.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How should people connect with you?</h2><p>You can find more information about me or get in touch with me by visiting my Crunchbase profile. Just visit the site and search for my name, “Jennifer Miree Cope.”</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC1za2cq66ZmsRuw8itn2ailaO7qrLEq2SmoaKasm6vzqmcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./if-those-deadpool-3-rumors-are-true-here-are-the-5-deadpool-variants-we-want-to-see.html><span>←</span><span>If those Deadpool 3 rumors are true, here are the 5 Deadpool variants we want to see</span></a>
