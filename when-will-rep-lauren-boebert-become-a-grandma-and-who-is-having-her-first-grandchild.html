She said her biggest fear was that her son’s partner would not “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">choose life</a>.” After revealing that the mother was going to proceed with the pregnancy, the congresswoman said that she was “so proud of them.” A teen mom herself, Boebert dropped out of high school in her senior year. Speaking to the Durango Herald in 2020, she said of that time, “I was a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new mom</a>, and I had to make hard decisions on successfully raising my child or getting to high school biology class, and I chose to take care of my child.”</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>From 2013 to 2022, she co-owned Shooters Grill in Rifle, Colorado. The restaurant became famous for its policy of allowing staff to openly carry firearms, and Boebert herself was pictured sporting a pistol. She has spoken out heavily against gun control, including the restriction of assault rifle sales. In 2021, she made headlines by wearing a controversial T-shirt with the slogan, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guns don’t kill people; Alec Baldwin does</a>.”</p><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=96 data-injectable=false>In November 2022, she was nearly ousted from her seat by a shockingly close margin of 600 votes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmegpLmqwMicqmivmJq7bsPIpaNmqpWleq2t1Kucp2WSpLKjsdGtZJudk6S6pnnAZp6rmZ6ZuqJ5wKebZq%2BYpHqqv4yhmK%2Bhnpx6qbHRZp2iqqOpeqi%2BwKebnKCZobFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-derrickson.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Derrickson movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
