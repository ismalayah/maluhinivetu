Soon, Dr. Dre increased his net worth with ‘The Chronic’, his debut solo studio album released on his own record label ‘Death Row Records’, which received generally positive reviews from music critics. In 1994, the songs ‘Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang’ and ‘Let Me Ride’ were nominated at the 36th Grammy Awards, where Dr. Dre won the Best Rap Solo Performance, and ‘The Chronic’ with G-funk sound dominating became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>In 1996, his second album called ‘Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath’ was released. Although it added to Dr. Dre’s net worth and was certified platinum, it received mixed reviews and was not amongst the year’s most commercially successful releases. His following album ‘2001’ reached second place on the US Billboard 200 chart, as after the first week 516,000 copies were sold. Despite being criticized for his lyrics, ‘2001’ was still well evaluated by music critics and was loved by listeners, to the extent that as of July 2013 the album grossed seven million copies sold in the US alone.</p><p>Following the success of ‘2001’, Dr. Dre increased his net worth producing songs and albums for other artists.
