In a 2007 interview with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/celebrity/exclusive-interview-jennifer-aniston/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, she explained, “It’s funny. I had a deviated septum fixed – the best thing I ever did. I slept like a baby for the first time in years.</p><p>As far as all the other rumors, as dull as it sounds, it’s still mine. All of it. Still mine.” Some people have noticed that her nose appears softer and more feminine after the surgery.</p><p>As Jennifer aged, her face went through changes. Her chin became more prominent as she lost some face fat. However, over time, her chin became shorter, leading many fans to speculate about chin surgery.</p><p>Chin implants are <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chin-implant-surgery-rates-rise-71-since-2010-why/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">increasingly popular</a>, even more so than breast augmentation, according to doctors. Many celebrities have opted for chin surgery to achieve balanced facial proportions. While Jennifer Aniston hasn’t publicly confirmed chin surgery, it’s evident that some alteration has been made to her chin.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1264 rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Champion Plastic Surgery: Unveiling the Secrets Behind His Timeless Looks</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebtransformations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/P2-7.webp><p>She also underwent procedures to reduce smile lines caused by her deep smile. These treatments have helped her maintain a youthful appearance with flawless skin that shows no signs of aging. However, she hasn’t gone to extremes with these procedures, aiming to preserve her natural charm.</p><p>Dermatologists note that such interventions are common among older women, especially Hollywood stars who want to maintain a youthful and beautiful look.</p><p>There’s speculation that Jennifer Aniston may have had breast augmentation, as her breasts appear somewhat larger to some experts. When questioned about this, she firmly denied it, stating, “As boring as it sounds, it’s still mine, all of it. Still mine.”</p><p>She added, “I am not against it, but I am happy with what God made me like.” Some medical professionals believe that the perceived change in her breast size is due to exceptionally padded bras. Aniston attributes any difference to weight fluctuations, which is likely the case.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234 rel="noreferrer noopener">Becky Lynch Plastic Surgery: The Truth Behind Her Stunning ESPY Appearance</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Summary</h2><p>Jennifer Aniston, just like many other Hollywood stars, has undergone various beauty and facial treatments.
