One of the most suspicious, and to some degree intriguing, is Mrs. Dodds (Megan Mullally).</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>At the beginning of the story, she looks like an ordinary teacher. I mean, she doesn’t strike us as a particularly kind teacher to Percy (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Walker Scobell</a>), but at least she has a human appearance. Still, something about her demeanor feels odd right off the bat, leaving the audience to question what her true intentions are.

As soon as she’s certain that Percy is who she’s looking for, she sheds her human persona and attacks him, revealing her true colors.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>In the grand scheme of things, Mrs. Dodds isn’t a major threat to Percy.
