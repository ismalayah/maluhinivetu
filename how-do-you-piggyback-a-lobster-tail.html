You should cut the lobster all the way back to the very tip of the fin. Try to avoid cutting into the meat, so that <b>it does not break apart during the boiling</b>. Instead, keep the shears well above the meat by pulling up on the shell as you cut.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-serve-lobster-tails-like-a-restaurant></span>How do you serve lobster tails like a restaurant?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-better-to-boil-or-bake-lobster-tails></span>Is it better to boil or bake lobster tails?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Options For Cooking Lobster Tails At Home<p>When you buy lobster tails, you can steam them, boil them, grill them, bake them, broil them or even smoke them. If you aren’t sure which method to use, we strongly recommend <b>boiling your lobster tails</b> because it’s your best chance to avoid the tails sticking to the shell.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-keep-lobster-tails-from-curling></span>How do you keep lobster tails from curling?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>An easy way to prevent lobster tails from curling up while cooking? <b>Place a skewer down the middle of the tail</b>, OR “butterfly” them using a very sharp knife or kitchen shears to carefully make a slit down the middle of the tail’s underside.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-my-lobster-rubbery></span>Why is my lobster rubbery?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Tough or rubbery meat is <b>usually the result of a lobster cooked too long</b>. See our cooking guide for suggested cooking times for live lobster.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-lobster-better-steamed-or-broiled></span>Is lobster better steamed or broiled?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The first rule, do not to overcook the lobster.

To ensure the lobsters are clean, scrub the shell only, not the exposed meat. Do not submerge the tails in water as the meat can absorb the liquid, creating a watery tasting lobster.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-part-of-lobster-can-you-not-eat></span>What part of lobster can you not eat?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Shell and Claws</b><p><b>The shell of a lobster cannot be eaten</b>. It is to hard and difficult for the human mouth to chew, and swallowing it would be impossible. Claws are just as hard, but also pointy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-boil-lobster-with-rubber-bands></span>Can you boil lobster with rubber bands?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Lobsters come with their <b>claws wrapped in a rubber band</b>. This is a safety measure to keep them from clawing at each other in the tank…but it also protects you, so keep the bands on until they are done cooking.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-you-put-lobster-in-cold-water-after-boiling></span>Do you put lobster in cold water after boiling?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Once the lobster is cooked (I personally prefer steaming), <b>let it cool down for a few minutes</b>, either with cold water, an ice bath or at room temperature. Remember that the lobster keeps cooking after being steamed, so I prefer to shock it with ice to stop the cooking immediately to prevent over-cooking.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-black-stuff-inside-lobster-tail></span>What is the black stuff inside lobster tail?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>These are <b>immature eggs called roe</b> and are naturally black. If the eggs are black and not red when you are ready to eat your lobster, that means the lobster needs to be cooked further. Once the eggs are red — meaning they’re cooked — they can be eaten.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-my-cooked-lobster-mushy></span>Why is my cooked lobster mushy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Some varieties of fish and shellfish, including lobsters, contain higher-than-normal levels of those protein-digesting enzymes. … Death triggers the enzyme, and <b>freezing slows</b> but doesn’t inactivate it, so you’re most likely to experience mushy lobster with frozen tails.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-my-lobster-tail-tough></span>Why is my lobster tail tough?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If you overcook them</b>, you will be eating tough lobster. If you under-cook them you can always heat them up. The reason many people believe larger lobsters are tough is simply because they overcook them. Just remember to bring your pot back to a rolling boil and regulate the heat.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-boil-lobster-tails-frozen></span>Can you boil lobster tails frozen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Cooking Frozen Lobster Tails<p>salt, if desired, for each quart of water. <b>Place thawed tails in boiling water</b>.
