We were exploring certain emotions that I have definitely never experienced before. And then on top of that, being a producer, dealing with the day-to-day problems that come with any film set, just added that extra level of pressure. I’m now taking a year off, and that is a result of how difficult this show was.”</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Holland is prioritizing self-care like a Gen Z boss, as he takes time to replenish his spirits, soak up new inspiration, and evolve. Nevertheless, the news of his hiatus dashed the hopes of disgruntled Marvel fans who want the next installment of the&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;franchise to happen sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Seething over the inevitable delay caused by his sabbatical, they criticized Holland’s other film ventures. One fan posted the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dismal Rotten Tomatoes rating for&nbsp;The Crowded Room</a>&nbsp;and suggested that its critical failure is the real reason the actor is taking a break.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dude just cant escape the web to save himself from Spiderman! 😭 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t3s91ieEhL</a></p>— 🅳🅴🅽🅽🅸🆂 (@dennis_k_g) <a href=#>June 7, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Many fans believed that the British actor needed some well-deserved rest and relaxation, considering the lackluster performance of his other films.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I would too if all my roles outside Spiderman were critical and financial bombs.

It’s likely that to some extent the strike informed his decision to take a break as screenplays are the substance of the film business, and without writers to create vehicles for film studios to produce, promote, and profit from, the entire industry grinds to a halt.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>While fans roast Holland on social media, it’s worth noting that at only 27, his films have grossed over $10 billion. Whether his hiatus is due to his ambigous support of the WGA, the poor performance of&nbsp;The Crowded Room,&nbsp;or other reasons, it is undeniably well-deserved</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, at least we can rewatch many of his outings as Spider-Man — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including Spider-Man: Homecoming</a> — on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6ilXZ28rbjAp5tmrJGgtq%2BzjJpksp2Rp3qwssVmnaunnWKupMDIp55moaNiwamxjKecsKtdqL2qsMSrZKaZnmKBbr%2FUqaeoqqSav7R5w6Kbp6xdrK6vwIytpmaglZa%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pokemon-protagonist-mafia-end-game-mafia-win-may-10-2015-174672.html><span>←</span><span>Pokemon Protagonist Mafia - END GAME: MAFIA WIN - May/10/2015 | Page 14</span></a>
