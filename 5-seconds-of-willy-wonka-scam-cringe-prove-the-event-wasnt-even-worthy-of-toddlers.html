Recommended Videos The more we learn about the “experience,” the more certain we are that it was an actual scam. Imagine paying £35 a ticket (or $40 in USD) to attend a “Willy Wonka” event without chocolatey delights.

What kind of fresh Chitty Chitty Bang Bang hell is this?! The whole thing took place inside an empty warehouse (!!!!) decorated with a few posters and a bouncy castle. (I repeat ⏤ posters and a bouncy castle.)

That’s quite an ingenious way of recreating the sensation the child competitors in the story must have felt upon elimination, if you ask me. Some outraged participants may have also called Police Scotland, because they got involved when the show was cancelled.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>The House of Illuminati, which was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the event organizer</a>, released a statement apologizing for the fiasco and promising a full refund to every participant. “We fully apologize for what has happened and will be giving full refunds to each and every person that purchased tickets,” the Facebook statement read. Thank goodness ⏤ a heaping plate of justice after not even a spoonful of chocolate.</p><p data-characters=572 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>Here’s a pro tip, folks: The next time you see an event that’s being promoted using AI-generated art (rife with spelling mistakes and improper grammar, I might add)‚ perhaps take the time to thoroughly research the organization behind it or even ask yourself if you’d like to pay money for an experience that can’t even be bothered to use authentic promo material. Because if there’s one thing we can say with certainty, it’s that this kind of thing will definitely happen again in one form or another, especially when AI is involved.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>And here we were thinking that the worst thing that could happen to Willy Wonka was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Timothée Chalamet</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmegpL1ur9Slq66qlWSCbr%2FEnKannKNivKd51qKjpbFdrLyvt8BmqpyZnWKws7XNoJxmqKKkw6Z506GcZp2mmru1edaaqqesXZrDprqMsKarrJiuerCyjK2mnZycmr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./thomas-rhetts-2023-home-team-tour-dates-and-how-to-buy-tickets.html><span>←</span><span>Thomas Rhetts 2023 Home Team tour dates and how to buy tickets</span></a>
